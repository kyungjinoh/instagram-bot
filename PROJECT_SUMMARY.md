### What Happens Automatically

```

2. Clicks "Followers" button
3. Visits each follower's profile
4. Checks bio for keywords (e.g., "ahs", "American", "Heritage")
5. Follows if keyword found
6. After 5 follows: Waits 1 hour automatically
7. Continues until max follows reached

```

### Timeline Expectations

- **First follow**: 2-5 minutes
- **5 follows (hourly max)**: 15-45 minutes

- **One school**: Several hours to days (varies)

---

## 📈 Statistics Tracking

The extension tracks and displays:

- **Current School**: Which school is being processed
- **Accounts Processed**: Progress through Instagram accounts (e.g., 3/5)
- **Follows This Hour**: Current hourly count (max 5)
- **Total Follows**: Total for selected school (vs. max limit)

Statistics persist across browser sessions!

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notes

### Instagram's Rules

Instagram limits automation to prevent spam:
- **5 follows per hour** = Safe
- **50+ follows per hour** = Likely blocked
- **Running 24/7** = Suspicious
- **Mixed with manual use** = Better

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Use a test/secondary account first
- Monitor the bot closely
- Let it wait the full hour between batches
- Stop if Instagram shows warnings
- Mix with normal Instagram usage

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use your main account without testing
- Try to bypass the 5/hour limit
- Run 24/7 without breaks
- Ignore "Action Blocked" warnings
- Follow random accounts indiscriminately

### If You Get Blocked

Instagram may temporarily block actions if it detects automation:
1. **Stop the bot immediately**
2. **Wait 24-48 hours**
3. **Use Instagram normally** (browse, like, comment)
4. **Resume carefully** after the block lifts

---

## 🛠️ Customization

### To Add/Modify Schools

Edit `popup.js`, find the `CSV_DATA` constant around line 2:

```javascript
const CSV_DATA = `School Name,Instagram ID,Abbreviation
Your School Name,"account1, account2, account3","keyword1, keyword2"
...
```

Add new rows following the format:
- **School Name**: Official name of the school
- **Instagram IDs**: Comma-separated account usernames
- **Keywords**: Comma-separated bio keywords (case-insensitive)

After editing, reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### To Change Rate Limits

**⚠️ Not Recommended**: The 5/hour limit is for your safety.

If you must change it, edit `content.js` line ~262:
```javascript
if (config.followsThisHour >= 5) {  // Change 5 to your limit
```

And line ~265:
```javascript
config.hourResetTime = Date.now() + 3600000;  // 1 hour in milliseconds
```

## 🎓 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

```
Step 1: You select a school → "Ahpbathletics (5 accounts)"

Step 2: Extension reads:
  - Instagram accounts: [ahpbathletics, ahs_info_stuco, ...]
  - Keywords: [ahs, American, Heritage]
  - Max follows: 1000

Step 3: Opens first account → instagram.com/ahpbathletics

Step 4: Clicks "Followers" button → Opens followers list

Step 5: For each follower:
  - Visits their profile
  - Reads their bio
  - If bio contains "ahs" or "American" or "Heritage":
    → Clicks "Follow"
  - Goes back to followers list
  
Step 6: After 5 follows → Waits 1 hour (automatic)

Step 7: After 1 hour → Resets counter, continues

Step 8: When done with first account → Moves to ahs_info_stuco

Step 9: Repeats until max follows (1000) reached

Step 10: Shows "Completed!" message
```

Simple, automated, and safe!
