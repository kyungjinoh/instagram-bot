# Testing Guide for Instagram School Follower Bot

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Chrome browser installed
- ‚úÖ Instagram account (preferably a test account)
- ‚úÖ Extension loaded in Chrome (see INSTALL.txt)
- ‚úÖ Logged into Instagram

### Safety First

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Instagram has strict automation policies. To test safely:

1. **Use a secondary/test Instagram account** - NOT your main account
2. **Start with low limits** - Test with 1-2 follows first
3. **Monitor closely** - Watch the bot in action
4. **Be patient** - Allow the 1-hour wait between follow batches

## Step-by-Step Testing

### Test 1: Basic Functionality (5 minutes)

1. **Open Instagram**
   - Go to https://www.instagram.com
   - Ensure you're logged in

2. **Open the Extension**
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
   - You should see the popup with school selection

3. **Select a School**
   - Choose any school from the dropdown
   - Example: "Ahpbathletics (5 accounts, max: 1000)"
   - Note: You can leave "Current Following Count" empty

4. **Start the Bot**
   - Click "Start Following" button
   - A new tab should open with the first Instagram account
   - Example: https://www.instagram.com/ahpbathletics/

5. **Watch the Automation**
   - The bot should automatically:
     - Wait 2-4 seconds (random delay)
     - Click the "Followers" or "ÌåîÎ°úÏõå" link
     - Open the followers dialog
     - Start visiting follower profiles

6. **Monitor the Extension**
   - Keep the extension popup open
   - Watch the statistics update:
     - Accounts Processed: 1/5
     - Follows This Hour: 0/5
     - Total Follows: 0/1000

### Test 2: Bio Checking (Watch for 10 minutes)

1. **Observe Profile Visits**
   - The bot will visit follower profiles one by one
   - It checks each bio for keywords (e.g., "ahs", "American", "Heritage")

2. **Check Following Behavior**
   - When a bio contains the keyword, the bot clicks "Follow"
   - Statistics should update: "Follows This Hour: 1/5"
   - The bot then returns to the followers list

3. **Verify Back Navigation**
   - After checking a profile, browser should go back
   - Bot should continue with the next follower

### Test 3: Rate Limiting (1+ hours)

1. **Watch for 5 Follows**
   - Let the bot follow 5 users (may take 15-30 minutes)
   - After the 5th follow, status should say: "Waiting XX minutes"

2. **Verify Wait Period**
   - Bot should pause for approximately 1 hour
   - Extension popup should show: "Follows This Hour: 5/5"

3. **Check Auto-Resume**
   - After 1 hour, the counter should reset: "Follows This Hour: 0/5"
   - Bot should automatically resume following

### Test 4: Account Switching

1. **Let Bot Finish First Account**
   - This may take several hours depending on followers
   - Bot will eventually move to the next Instagram account

2. **Verify Account Change**
   - Status should update: "Moving to account 2/5"
   - Browser should navigate to the second Instagram ID
   - Process repeats: Click followers ‚Üí Visit profiles ‚Üí Follow

3. **Check Progress**
   - "Accounts Processed" should increment: 2/5, 3/5, etc.

## What to Watch For

### ‚úÖ Good Signs
