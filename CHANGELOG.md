# Changelog

## Version 1.1.0 - Major Workflow Improvement

### ðŸš€ New Features

**Complete Follower Collection First**
- Bot now scrolls through the ENTIRE followers list before visiting any profiles
- Collects and stores all follower usernames in memory
- Then systematically visits each profile from the collected list
- Much more organized and efficient process

### ðŸ“‹ Detailed Changes

**Old Workflow:**
```
1. Open account
2. Click followers
3. Visit first follower â†’ Check â†’ Go back
4. Scroll a bit to load more
5. Visit next follower â†’ Check â†’ Go back
6. Repeat...
```

**New Workflow:**
```
1. Open account
2. Click followers
3. Scroll ALL the way down (collect 100s or 1000s of usernames)
4. Store all usernames
5. Visit profile 1 â†’ Check â†’ Move to profile 2
6. Visit profile 2 â†’ Check â†’ Move to profile 3
7. Continue until all collected followers are processed
8. Move to next Instagram account
9. Repeat
```

### âœ… Benefits

- **More Efficient**: No need to go back and forth between followers list
- **Better Organization**: Know exactly how many followers to process upfront
- **Progress Tracking**: Can show "Processing 45/523 followers"
- **Reduced Scrolling**: Only scrolls once per account (at the beginning)
- **Cleaner Logic**: Simpler state management

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

**content.js**
- Added `scrollAndCollectAllFollowers()` function
- Scrolls until no new followers appear
- Stores usernames in `config.currentAccountFollowers` array
- New state: `followersCollected` flag
- Tracks progress with `currentFollowerIndex`
- Removed old incremental scrolling logic

**popup.js**
- Added new config properties:
  - `currentAccountFollowers`: Array of collected usernames
  - `followersCollected`: Boolean flag
  - `currentFollowerIndex`: Current position in the list

**Removed Features**
- `visitedProfiles` tracking (no longer needed with new approach)
- Incremental scrolling between profile visits

### ðŸ“Š Performance

- **Before**: Visit â†’ Back â†’ Scroll â†’ Wait â†’ Visit (many round trips)
- **After**: Scroll once â†’ Visit â†’ Visit â†’ Visit (direct path)
