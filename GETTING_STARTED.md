## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Rules

### The 5-Per-Hour Rule
- Instagram limits automated actions
- Bot follows max 5 people per hour
- After 5th follow, automatically waits 1 hour
- **DO NOT** try to bypass this - it's for your safety

### Daily Limit Protection
- Bot automatically detects Instagram's daily limit popup
- When "You've reached your daily limit" appears, bot automatically closes it
- Bot continues running and will resume when limits reset
- No manual intervention needed when daily limits are hit

### Max Follows Per School
- Each school has a maximum (from CSV)
- Bot stops when limit reached
- Prevents excessive following

### Keep Tab Open
- Don't close the Instagram tab
- Bot needs the page open to work
- You can use other tabs, just keep Instagram open

```
